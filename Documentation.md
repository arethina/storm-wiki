### Trident

Trident is an alternative interface to Storm. It provides exactly-once processing, "transactional" datastore persistence, and a set of common stream analytics operations.

* [[Trident Tutorial]]     -- basic concepts and walkthrough
* [[Trident API Overview]] -- operations for transforming and orchestrating data
* [[Trident State]]        -- exactly-once processing and fast, persistent aggregation
* [[Trident spouts]]       -- transactional and non-transactional data intake

### Setup and deploying
